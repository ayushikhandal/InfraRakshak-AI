# 🚀 InfraRakshak AI  
### AI-Powered Proactive Infrastructure Monitoring System

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Critical infrastructure systems such as power grids, telecom networks, and water supply systems generate massive volumes of operational logs. Most existing solutions are reactive, detecting failures only after disruption occurs. This leads to downtime, economic loss, and public inconvenience.

There is a need for a scalable, AI-driven solution that can proactively detect anomalies, predict failures, and provide explainable insights in real time.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

InfraRakshak AI is a cloud-native, AI-powered monitoring system designed to:

- Detect anomalies in real-time infrastructure logs  
- Predict potential failures before they occur  
- Classify fault severity levels  
- Estimate time-to-failure  
- Generate AI-based root cause explanations  
- Provide actionable alerts and dashboards  

The solution leverages Machine Learning and Generative AI to transform reactive monitoring into proactive intelligence.
