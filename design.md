## 3. Component Design

### 3.1 Data Ingestion
Logs are collected via AWS IoT Core or API Gateway and streamed using Amazon Kinesis.

### 3.2 Data Processing
AWS Lambda processes incoming logs, performs parsing, cleaning, and feature engineering.

### 3.3 AI & Machine Learning Engine
- Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest or similar models
- Fault Prediction using Random Forest / XGBoost
- Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA / LSTM)
- Severity Classification using supervised ML

### 3.4 Explainable AI Layer
Amazon Bedrock generates human-readable root cause explanations and recommended actions.

### 3.5 Visualization & Alerting
Amazon QuickSight provides dashboards.
Amazon SNS sends alerts via SMS or email.
